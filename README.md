# MDB-Mini-Project-1

This app is intended to help new members of MDB learn the names of other members of the club, and to learn the basics of iOS development. The app randomly selects a person in the club, and displays their picture, along with 4 different names that the user can choose from. One name is correct, while the other 3 are randomly chosen names of other club members. If the correct name is chosen, then the user's score increases by one. Moreover, the user only has 5 seconds to correctly identify the member of the club, and failure to do so in time results in a new name being chosen.
