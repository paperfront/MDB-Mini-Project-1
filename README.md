# MDB Meet the Members

This app is intended to help new members of MDB learn the names of other members of the club, and to learn the basics of iOS development. The app randomly selects a person in the club, and displays their picture, along with 4 different names that the user can choose from. One name is correct, while the other 3 are randomly chosen names of other club members. If the correct name is chosen, then the user's score increases by one. Moreover, the user only has 5 seconds to correctly identify the member of the club, and failure to do so in time results in a new name being chosen.

This image shows the first screen of the app, where the user can click the start button to transition onto the main game screen. Additionally, the screen shows the logo for the best club at Berkeley, MDB.

This screen is the main screen for the game. There is an image of a member, along with 4 options for their name. Underneath the names, there is a pause button where the user can pause the game at any time. Whenever the user correctly selects the name, the score at the bottom of the screen increases by 1. At the top right, the user can press the Stats button to transition to the statistics screen (see below image)

This screen shows 2 statistics: the current longest streak and the last 3 responses (whether or not they were correct). The user can return to where they left off by hitting the back button at the top left.
